## Hey 👋, I'm Rich Mudway

I enjoy working in many areas and currently use with C#, Vite + React.js with TypeScript, Rust, Agentic AI and LLMs

- ✨ C# i like the newer stuff (.NET + Asp.Net Core) not the legacy stuff. This is because i like working on Linux.

- ❤️ Yes, yes, gently falling in love with Garuda Linux... shhh 🤫🙊 don't tell Ubuntu or Mint - they're still really really good friends

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and AI (Agentic + MCP + LLMs)

- 🍳 I like to cook my code with Rider or VsCode
   - 🛠️ I do have a NeoVim setup, but went back to VsCode and just customised what i like over there... now i'm done...
